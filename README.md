# LameSpaceCollector

Having always had a problem with being stuck in a tutorial rut, this project is the first I've built 
without following any particular tutorial, but through extensive googling, a few YouTube videos and some prior knowledge of Unity.
Hence, it's pretty boring and lame, and has some bugs. Screenshots of gameplay are included below.
